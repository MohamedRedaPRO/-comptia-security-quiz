A hardware security module (HSM) is a hardware device used to cre- ate and store encryption keys, among other encryption- related functions. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is a term used in encryption systems that change keys frequently to ensure that even if a key is hacked, the attacker’s access to data will exist in a limited window. Private keys are part of asymmetric encryption schemes and do not reflect the full solution Yasmine’s organization is using.",

Pass- the- hash attacks reuse hashes, and thus aren’t a technique used to prevent brute- force attacks against hashed passwords. Collision resistance is a requirement for an effective hashing algorithm and should be part of any password hash storage implementation.

Trusted platform modules (TPMs) are used to provide secure boot and related services, not to store secrets for an organization.",

    "explanation": "Password spraying is a specific type of brute- force attack that uses a smaller list of common passwords for many accounts to attempt to log in. Although brute forcing is tech- nically correct, the best match here is password spraying. When you encounter questions like this on the exam, make sure you provide the most accurate answer, rather than one that fits but that may not be the best answer. Limited login attacks is a made- up answer, and spinning an account refers to changing the password for an account, often because of a compromise or to prevent a user from logging back into it while preserving the account.",

    "_originalExplanation": "Salting uses a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password before it is hashed. That means that even matching passwords will not have the same hash. This pre- vents rainbow tables from being effectively used against password hashes due to the added computational load it creates for precomputing hashes.",

Pass- the- hash attacks reuse hashes, and thus aren’t a technique used to prevent brute- force attacks against hashed passwords. Collision resistance is a requirement for an effective hashing algorithm and should be part of any password hash storage implementation. Encrypting passwords is not a recommended practice because it leaves passwords in the hands of the organization rather than hashes and requires the organization to decrypt pass- words to check them when they are used, creating frequent opportunities for exposure.",

Low- power consumption designs may lack computational power and thus have chal- lenges implementing strong cryptography, network connectivity, and other similar problems. Patching embedded systems can be challenging both because of where they are deployed and because of a lack of connectivity for them—i n fact, in many environments, you may not want the devices to be connected to your network. Since many don’t have a screen, keyboard, or a network connection, authentication is also a problem.

LEAP, the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol, uses WEP keys for its encryption and is not recommended due to security issues.

Since services are rarely run at maximum capacity, and many can have maintenance windows scheduled, this does not mean that the load balancers cannot be patched.

This would work but is not the most efficient approach. Nothing in this scenario suggests that the NIPS is inadequate. It just is not seeing all the traffic.

Having multiple ven- dors and platforms helps to ensure that a single vendor’s failure or vulnerability does not prevent an organization from continuing to function. Platform agnostic is not on the Security+ exam but typically means that organizations don’t have a vested interest in which platform is selected or used. Multi-cloud environments run in multiple cloud vendors’ tools, but this question involves physical router hardware. Parallel processing is a failure testing mode where two or more sites run at the same time during a test.",

Since UPS systems are typically intended to run for minutes, rather than hours, for datacenters this should be Danielle’s first concern. No generator was mentioned, and in fact the UPS is her only power resilience con- trol. While a UPS may experience issues with surges when power resumes, temporary drops in voltage, and power outages are not uncommon even on well- maintained power grids, and UPS systems are designed to handle them under normal circumstances while protecting the systems they provide emergency power to.",

In addition, multi-cloud can drive additional costs for overhead services, making multi-cloud a choice organizations undertake cautiously.

Inline taps don’t have to rely on the performance of the switch, meaning that they are often higher performance; they can be passive, meaning that they cannot be attacked like a switch’s operating system can be; and since inline passive devices simply copy traffic, they are often easier to configure since you merely plug them in.",

Susan’s organization may keep logs for as little as 30 days depending on storage limitations and business needs. Data classification policies typically impact how data is secured and handled. Backup policies determine how long backups are retained and rotated and may have an impact on data if the logs are backed up, but backing up logs are a less common practice due to the space they take up versus the value of having logs backed up.

Henry knows that if his staff change their password periodically that it can help avoid issues with reuse on other sites. He also knows that multifactor is a more effective solu- tion and that he should focus his time there as well. Password length and complexity don’t matter if the password was compromised elsewhere, and minimum age policies are used to prevent reuse in the organization by resetting passwords over and over again to return to an original desired password. Note that policies like this don’t stop reuse outside of a user’s organization on 3rd party sites!",

This is more common when the application is contain- erized or otherwise easily portable. The more customized to the current cloud vendor the application or service is, the more difficult it is to move to other cloud vendors and the more costly the move will be. In addition, multi-cloud can drive additional costs for overhead services, making multi-cloud a choice organizations undertake cautiously. Deploy- ing in multiple AZs or regions will not avoid an outage if the IaaS vendor has a cloud- wide issue, and contractual obligations won’t stop outages— they will typically just provide pen- alties if there is an outage longer than the contract allows.",

Containerization would allow for easy deployment of applications to different service environments, but the focus for containerization is on portability, not on the design requirements listed.

If an inline device fails, it may impact the network traffic even if it is designed to avoid that scenario. Inline taps don’t have to rely on the performance of the switch, meaning that they are often higher performance; they can be passive, meaning that they cannot be attacked like a switch’s operating system can be; and since inline passive devices simply copy traffic, they are often easier to configure since you merely plug them in.",
