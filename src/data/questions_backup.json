A hardware security module (HSM) is a hardware device used to cre- ate and store encryption keys, among other encryption- related functions. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is a term used in encryption systems that change keys frequently to ensure that even if a key is hacked, the attacker’s access to data will exist in a limited window. Private keys are part of asymmetric encryption schemes and do not reflect the full solution Yasmine’s organization is using.",

Pass- the- hash attacks reuse hashes, and thus aren’t a technique used to prevent brute- force attacks against hashed passwords. Collision resistance is a requirement for an effective hashing algorithm and should be part of any password hash storage implementation.

In addition, multi-cloud can drive additional costs for overhead services, making multi-cloud a choice organizations undertake cautiously.

Inline taps don’t have to rely on the performance of the switch, meaning that they are often higher performance; they can be passive, meaning that they cannot be attacked like a switch’s operating system can be; and since inline passive devices simply copy traffic, they are often easier to configure since you merely plug them in.",

The three objectives are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which means authenticity is not a possible answer. Encryption does not increase availability, and integrity ensures that data has not been changed inad- vertently or maliciously. Thus, encryption can help, but it is not as strong of an answer as confidentiality.",

In addition, multi-cloud can drive additional costs for overhead services, making multi-cloud a choice organizations undertake cautiously.

Since UPS systems are typically intended to run for minutes, rather than hours, for datacenters this should be Danielle’s first concern. No generator was mentioned, and in fact the UPS is her only power resilience con- trol. While a UPS may experience issues with surges when power resumes, temporary drops in voltage, and power outages are not uncommon even on well- maintained power grids, and UPS systems are designed to handle them under normal circumstances while protecting the systems they provide emergency power to.",

In addition, multi-cloud can drive additional costs for overhead services, making multi-cloud a choice organizations undertake cautiously.
