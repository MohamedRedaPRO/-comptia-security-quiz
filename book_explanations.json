A recovery time objective, or RTO, is set by organizations to describe how long restoring systems or services to normal function after a disruption can take. Mean time to repair, or MTTR, is the average time it takes to repair a system or device. A recovery point objective, or RPO, describes how much data can be lost in the event of an outage or issue.",

This will drive KPIs as well as influence which actions and steps are taken to evolve the program.
